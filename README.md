# Engg Sketches : [Link to the Website](https://mitul-garg.github.io/enggsketches)
I built this website to practise my newly learned HTML and CSS. The website is made mainly to look good on mobile as more than 90% of our user base were mobile users.
The website helped us to conduct Art Competitions in a systematic and transparent way.
